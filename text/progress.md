Hi, today I decided start project dedicated person feature extraction based on social group in which person belongs.

During the work on the project I want to achieve the following goals:

1. Check out available solutions.
2. Develop a method for extracting information from a social network.
3. Develop data processing method.
4. Create user-friendly frontend interface. 
5. Put everything in docker so it's easy to deploy

Also I want examine new interesting libraries and approaches for graph analysis, processing and visualization.
